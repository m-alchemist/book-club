# Book Trading Club

This is a book trading club created using react-redux and mongodb.
This project was made for FCC baseJump. It meets the following criteria:
1. I can view all books posted by every user.

2. I can add a new book.

3. I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.

3. I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.
